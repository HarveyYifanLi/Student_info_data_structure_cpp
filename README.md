# Student_info_data_structure_cpp

This cpp program reads, stores, computes, and sorts the overall grades of
students by building up a Student_info class where we have defined all the necessary constructors,
private data members and public member functions such as Student_info::read(cin).

# The Code::Block Management Tree looks like this:

# Header Files:

Student_info.h – defining the data structure of the Student_info class and its associated private data members and public member functions and the declaration for the related non-member functions.
Declare the functions as defined in Student_info.cpp.

# Sources:

Student_info_report.cpp – this is the program that is run during the implementation phase.

Student_info.cpp – defining the constructors of the Student_info class and defining all the related 
member functions and non-member functions.
